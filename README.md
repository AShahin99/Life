# Life
Conway's Game of Life Interface implemented using the Pygame library.

This is a simple interface for the game of life that can be accessed using the command prompt. Make sure all the files are accesible from your command prompt directory.
To play simply type: python game.py into your command prompt and a popup window should appear. To exit the program simply close the window.
